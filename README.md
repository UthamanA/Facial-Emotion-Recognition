# Face-Emotion-Recognition
# Installation of python libraries:

  keras with tensorflow as backend
  
  OpenCV
  
  numpy
  
  pandas
  
  matplotlib
  
 # DataSet:
In this project I used kaggle dataset i.e
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview
we can use a kaggle API to access and download that dataset.

# Usage:
This project is in notebook format. I wrote the program in google colabs.

Google colabs is a cloud based notebook IDE which offers a free GPU and allows us to write python code snippets with ease. It is almost similar to jupyter notebook but slight variations. Some of the code snippets in the program is specific to google colabs. Dont get confuse.

In the notebook, I explain all the concepts, pipeline , terminology , functions which is involved in the program in a clear and concised manner. Even I also mention some of my insights , intuitions and observations in the project.
I document almost everything that is used in the program.
This notebook file is a complete wrapout of practical exposure, understanding and theory.


facial_Emotion_Recognition_using_cnn.ipnb --> main file

images folder --> consists of images to be tested and also contains screenshots of results of that images.

model.h5 --> saved weights of the model which is trained with 200 epochs

model.json --> saved architecture of the neural network.

haarcascade classifiers --> higly pretrained classifiers to detect faces.
